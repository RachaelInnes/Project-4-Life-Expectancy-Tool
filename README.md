# Project-4-Domain: Insurance

## Proposal Title: Project Introduction: Predicting Life Expectancy for Insurance Premium Adjustment

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the insurance industry, accurate risk assessment is crucial for profitability and sustainability. Life expectancy is a key factor influencing how insurance companies evaluate risk and set premium pricing for life and health insurance policies.

## Objective:
The objective is to create a modelling tool that insurance companies could utilise to make predictions of life expectancy to set premiums that reflect the actual risk level of their policyholders. For example, if a demographic shows a higher predicted life expectancy due to favorable health and economic conditions, insurers may adjust premiums downward, making their offerings more attractive. Life expectancy provides insight into the average lifespan of individuals within specific demographics or populations, allowing insurers to estimate the likelihood and timing of claims. By understanding the factors that contribute to varying life expectancies—such as health conditions, socio-economic status, and lifestyle choices—insurance companies can more accurately assess the risk associated with insuring individuals.

Competitive Advantage: Companies that utilize sophisticated predictive models can differentiate themselves in a crowded market. By providing personalized premium pricing based on a predictive analysis of life expectancy, insurers can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty while maintaining profitability
