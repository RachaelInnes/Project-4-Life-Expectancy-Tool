# Project-4-Life-Expectancy-Tool

## Proposal Title: Predicting Life Expectancy Using Socioeconomic and Health Data

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using health factors, including income level, access to healthcare, education machine learning model that estimates life expectancy based on various socioeconomic, and lifestyle choices. This model will assist in identifying key indicators that contribute to life expectancy and inform public health policies.

## Motivation:
Life expectancy is a key measure of population health and socioeconomic well-being. By understanding the relationship between life expectancy and influencing factors like healthcare access, lifestyle, and economic status, governments and organizations can better allocate resources and improve public health strategies. Predictive modeling can also assist in identifying at-risk populations.

## Data Source:
World Bank Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic Data: Contains life expectancy data along with variables such as GDP, schooling, and immunization.
